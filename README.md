## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Install dependencies using:
  
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

### Required API Key
This project requires a **Gemini API Key**. Get it from [Google AI](https://ai.google.dev/) and enter it in the application when prompted.

## Usage

### Run the Application
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

### Upload Course Images
1. Launch the application.
2. Enter your **Gemini API Key**.
3. Choose **Upload Images** and upload course images.
4. Extracted course data will be displayed and available for download as CSV.

### Use Test Data
1. Place test images in the `test_data` folder.
2. Select **Use test data** in the application.
3. The app will process all test images and display results.

## Data Extraction Methodology
The application follows a structured approach to extract course information with high accuracy:
- Uses **Gemini AI** to analyze text from images.
- Ensures **99.9% accuracy** with strict extraction rules.
- Avoids hallucinated or inferred data by returning `null` for missing fields.
- Cleans watermarks, logos, and irrelevant text from results.
